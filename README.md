## Introduction
The C++ Standard Template Library (STL) is a powerful set of C++ template classes to provide general-purpose classes and functions with templates that implement many popular and commonly used algorithms and data structures like vectors, lists, queues, and stacks.

## Getting Started
To get started with the STL examples in this repository, you'll need to have a working C++ environment. You can compile and run the provided code examples using a C++ compiler like GCC.

### Prerequisites
- C++11 or later
- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, MSVC)
- A text editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, CLion)

### Compiling the Code
You can compile any example in this repository using the following command in your terminal:

```bash
g++ -std=c++11 example.cpp -o example
